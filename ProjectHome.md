The objective of this project is to provide OS based Ubuntu including localized applications and utility for Ethiopian.
We translated some applications (Mozilla Firefox, OpenOffice, GIMP) and developed dictionary and Ethiopian calendar.
Finally we customized Ubuntu 8.10 Live-CD including Amharic language pack and the all of our products, then distributed it. Everyone can download, install, and use it freely. If you want to use it, please do as follows.

  1. Download 7 files from [download page](http://code.google.com/p/ethio-ubuntu/downloads/list).
  1. Make a iso file from these 7 files by copy command (in case of Windows) or cat command (in case of Linux). These script files also can be downloaded.
  1. Burn the iso file to CD-R by burning software.
  1. Install Ubuntu to your PC using the CD or use from the CD without installation.

**This project was developed by [JOCV(Japan Overseas Cooperation Volunteers)](http://www.jica.go.jp/english/operations/schemes/citizen/volunteers.html) dispatched by [JICA(Japan Internatonal Cooperation Agency)](http://www.jica.go.jp/english/) as volunteer activity. So JICA's logo was used unofficially as an acknowledgment of my gratitude. However, it will be deleted in the next version due to JICA's instruction.**
